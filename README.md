# CodeExamples
This repository contains examples of code I've written, such as class and personal projects. It is primarily
intended as a way to demonstrate my knowledge and skill for potential employers. Currently, this repository
contains the following projects:

* Implemented Data Structures
  * Linked List
  * Binary Search Tree
  * Binary Heap
* Matrix Multiplication
* Polymorphic Binary Search Tree

Currently the project are written in Java. Though I do have experience with C/C++ and Python, I am most
comfortable with Java. Additionally, I preferred to write these projects in Java as the Eclipse IDE's 
built-in Git functionality makes pushing code to GitHub very easy.

## About Each Project

### [Implemented Data Structures](https://github.com/isiic12/CodeExamples/tree/master/Implemented%20Data%20Structures/src)
<p>This folder contains my own implementations of common data structures, such as :
 
* [Linked List](https://github.com/isiic12/CodeExamples/tree/master/Implemented%20Data%20Structures/src/linkedlist)
* [Binary Search Trees](https://github.com/isiic12/CodeExamples/tree/master/Implemented%20Data%20Structures/src/binarysearchtree)
* [Binary Heaps](https://github.com/isiic12/CodeExamples/tree/master/Implemented%20Data%20Structures/src/binaryheaps)

Each of these data structures has their own README, explaining how they work and how I chose to implement them.
Currently, they are all implemented in Java.

### [Matrix Multiplication](https://github.com/isiic12/CodeExamples/tree/master/matrixMultiplication/src)
<p>This was a short project I completed for a freshman level course. It involved calculating the result
of two matricies (respresented as 2D arrays) being multiplied together using two separate methods. One was
a brute force approach, while the other used multi-threading to accomplish the task faster. Written in Java.

### [Polymorphic BST](https://github.com/isiic12/CodeExamples/tree/master/polymorphicTree)
<p>This was a project I wrote for a freshman year data structures course. Functionally it is no different than
a normal binary search trees, however it was built to demonstrate how polymorphism works. Written in Java.
